# SEO Enhancements
I replaced several of the html tags with more descriptive semantic tags, while also updating css to reflect new tags. Also I consolidated several CSS selectors to minimize excess code. Alt tags were inserted for all the images to assist those relying on screen readers or having difficulty loading, also inserted ID for broken link for page navigation.
